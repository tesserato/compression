Repository for the .hc (Harmonic Compression) and .pc (Pseudo cycles based compression). Since the codebases for both formats share a considerable portion of the code (.wav reading, saving, segmentation of pseudo cycles, etc), the authors decided to unify development in a single repository, and release a single executable for both codecs.

# Installation
The executable for Windows 64 bits OS can be downloaded in the releases section, along with the necessary libsndfile-1.dll, as a .zip archive. Those can be unpacked to a convenient folder and referenced via relative paths, or manually added to the system path.

For other OSs, it should be possible to compile the source code via the Visual Studio solution.
